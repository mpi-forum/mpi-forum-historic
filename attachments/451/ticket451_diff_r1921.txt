+\item[\mpiterm{nonblocking}] A procedure is nonblocking if it may return before the associated
 operation completes, and before the user is allowed to reuse
 resources (such as buffers) specified in the call.
-A nonblocking request is \mpiterm{started} by the call that initiates it, e.g., 
-\mpifunc{MPI\_ISEND}.

+The word complete is used with respect to operations and any associated requests and/or
 communications.  An \mpiterm{operation completes} when the user is allowed
-to reuse resources, and any output buffers have been updated; i.e., a
-call to \mpifunc{MPI\_TEST} will return
-\mpiarg{flag}~=~\consti{true}.  A \mpiterm{request is completed} by a call
-to wait, which returns, or a test or get status call which returns 
-\mpiarg{flag}~=~\consti{true}.  This completing call has two effects:
-the status is extracted from the request; in the case of test and
-wait, if the request was nonpersistent, it is 
-\mpiterm{freed}, and becomes \mpiterm{inactive} if it was persistent.
-A \mpiterm{communication completes} when all participating operations complete.

 \item[\mpiterm{blocking}] A procedure is blocking if return from the procedure indicates the user
 is allowed to reuse resources specified in the call.
